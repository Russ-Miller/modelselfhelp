**What is wrong with it?** (delete what does not apply)
- The finding does not hold — here is a source that cuts against it:
- The scope is wrong — it holds, but not under the conditions stated:
- The sources do not say this:
- Something else:

**What should change?** (delete what does not apply)
- This is not a real topic — it should be dropped:
- This is really the same thing as another capability — merge it with:
- This is two things and should be split into:
- The boundary is wrong — it should include / exclude:
- The name or wording is misleading:
