          A nightly job queries OpenAlex for new arXiv papers, filters them to work that is
          plausibly about a capability tracked here, and asks a model to judge whether each paper
          is genuinely about that capability and whether it supports or cuts against something
          already filed. Papers that survive get read in full, and a model drafts a proposed
          claim from them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
          Drafts are not endorsed. They enter the catalog marked{" "}
          <strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200">pending review</strong>,
          and the rule for those is: visible everywhere, authoritative nowhere. They appear in
          lists, counts and the contested view like anything else, because an index is useful
          before it is verified and hiding half of it would be a lie by omission. They are
          excluded only where a claim would silently decide something &mdash; whether a technique
          is judged to work, and the internal scorecard that tracks whether this catalog is
          getting things right.

          Right now: {pending.length} of {claims.length} claims are pending review, and{" "}

          may stay that way. Reviewing is slow and there is more worth indexing than one person
          can check, so &ldquo;unreviewed&rdquo; is a normal permanent state here, not a queue
          waiting to be cleared.
