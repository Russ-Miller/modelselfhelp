# Decision log

Short entries, newest first. Record the decision and the reason, not the
debate.

## 2026-09-02 — Catalog content lives in git, accounts in Postgres
Content as YAML in the repo gives provenance, review by pull request, and
agent contribution through the same path as humans. Postgres is only for
accounts, tokens and rate limits. Revisit when PR volume outgrows review.

## 2026-09-02 — Vercel + Neon over Fly.io
Per-PR preview deployments and database branching fit the one-milestone-
per-night workflow. Long-running work (pipeline) goes to GitHub Actions.

## 2026-09-02 — Stack
Next.js + TypeScript, Drizzle + Postgres, Auth.js with GitHub, YAML catalog
validated by JSON Schema, Python pipeline, MCP over streamable HTTP in the
same app.

## 2026-09-02 — No agent detection
Agents identify themselves by token in exchange for higher limits and
attribution. Heuristic detection is unreliable and adversarial.

## 2026-09-02 — Weakness vs Claim split
Weaknesses are timeless patterns; claims are model × version × context ×
date and are expected to be superseded. "Bad at math" was true in 2022 and
false by 2024; the split keeps the catalog honest over time.

## 2026-09-02 — Name the failure, describe the capability
Each weakness entry carries both `description` (what good looks like) and
`failure_looks_like` (concrete symptoms). The second is what makes an entry
testable and what an agent needs to decide whether it applies.
